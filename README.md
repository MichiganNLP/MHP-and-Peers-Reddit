# Exploring Self-Identified Counseling Expertise in Online Support Forums

## Data

- [task_data.csv](./Data/task_data.csv): contains the post ids, comment ids, subreddit names, and author type (mhp or non-mhp) of each data instance used in this study.
- [subreddit_topics.csv](./Data/subreddit_topics.csv): Contains the health topics for the subreddits. 
  
  To create these topics, we began with Sharma & Munmun (2018)'s subreddit categorization, which includes the categories *Trauma & Abuse,* *Psychosis & Anxiety,* *Compulsive Disorders,* *Coping & Therapy,* and *Mood Disorders.* Then, we used [World Health Organization's ICD-10 classification system of mental and behavioural disorders](https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/icd_10/en/) as a basis for categorizing the additional subreddits in our study, and to adjust and add to the original categories.
